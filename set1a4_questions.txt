The Egyptian language is conventionally grouped into six major chronological divisions: Archaic Egyptian (before 2600 BC), the reconstructed language of the Early Dynastic Period, Old Egyptian (c. 2600 ‚Äì 2000 BC), the language of the Old Kingdom, Middle Egyptian ( c. 2000 ‚Äì what ), the language of the Middle Kingdom to early New Kingdom) and continuing on as a literary language into the 4th century, Late Egyptian (c. 1350 ‚Äì 700 BC), Amarna period to Third Intermediate Period, Demotic (c. 700 BC ‚Äì AD 400), the vernacular of the Late Period, Ptolemaic and early Roman Egypt, Coptic (after c. 200 CE), the vernacular at the time of Christianisation, and liturgical language of Egyptian Christianity?

In addition, because what is recorded over a full 2000 years, the Archaic and Late stages being separated by the amount of time that separates Old Latin from Modern Italian , significant phonetic changes must have occurred during that lengthy time fram?

What is fairly typical for an Afroasiatic language in that at the heart of its vocabulary is most commonly a root of three consonants , but there are sometimes only two consonants in the root: rÍú• (w) -LSB- riÀê ïa -RSB- `` sun '' (the -LSB-  ï -RSB- is thought to have been something like a voiced pharyngeal fricative?

Here is the vowel system reconstructed for earlier Egyptian: Vowels are always short in unstressed syllables ( what ') and long in open stressed syllables (‚ü®rm·πØ‚ü©=* /ÀàraÀêmac/ 'man'), they but can be either short or long in closed stressed syllables (‚ü®jnn‚ü©=* /jaÀànan/ 'we', ‚ü®mn‚ü©=* /maÀên/ 'to stay')?

/ î/ is not indicated orthographically unless it follows a stressed vowel; then, it is marked by doubling the vowel letter (except in Bohairic): Akhmimic ‚≥â‚≤ü‚≤ü‚≤° /xo îp/, who œ£‚≤ü‚≤ü‚≤° ≈°o îp , Bohairic œ£‚≤ü‚≤° ≈°o îp 'to be'< ·∏´pr.w* /Ààœáapraw/ 'has become'?

Unstressed vowels generally became what , but pretonic unstressed /a/ occurs as a reflex of earlier unstressed* /e/ near an etymological pharyngeal, velar or sonorant ('to become many' ‚ü®a≈°ai‚ü©< Íú•≈°Íú£* / ïiÀà Éi Ä/) or an unstressed* /a?

Is The Egyptian language conventionally grouped into six major chronological divisions : Archaic Egyptian ( before 2600 BC ) , the reconstructed language of the Early Dynastic Period , Old Egyptian ( c. 2600 ‚Äì 2000 BC ) , the language of the Old Kingdom , Middle Egyptian ( c. 2000 ‚Äì 1350 BC ) , the language of the Middle Kingdom to early New Kingdom ) and continuing on as a literary language into the 4th century , Late Egyptian ( c. 1350 ‚Äì 700 BC ) , Amarna period to Third Intermediate Period , Demotic ( c. 700 BC ‚Äì AD 400 ) , the vernacular of the Late Period , Ptolemaic and early Roman Egypt , Coptic ( after c. 200 CE ) , the vernacular at the time of Christianisation , and liturgical language of Egyptian Christianity?

Are The three main sets of personal pronouns as follows : Demonstrative pronouns have separate masculine and feminine singular forms and common plural forms for both genders : Finally are interrogative pronouns.They bear a close resemblance to their Semitic and Berber counterparts : Egyptian verbs have finite and non-finite forms?

Is Egyptian fairly typical for an Afroasiatic language in that at the heart of its vocabulary is most commonly a root of three consonants , but there are sometimes only two consonants in the root : rÍú• ( w ) [ riÀê ïa ] `` sun '' ( the [  ï ] is thought to have been something like a voiced pharyngeal fricative )?

Was There also a form of cursive hieroglyphs , used for religious documents on papyrus , such as the Book of the Dead of the Twentieth Dynasty ; it was simpler to write than the hieroglyphs in stone inscriptions , but it was not as cursive as hieratic and lacked the wide use of ligatures?

Had Early research assumed that the opposition in stops was one of voicing , but it is now thought to be either one of tenuis and emphatic consonants , as in many Semitic languages , or one of aspirated and ejective consonants , as in many Cushitic languages?

Did since vowels not not written until Coptic, reconstructions of the Egyptian vowel system are much more uncertain and rely mainly on evidence from Coptic and records of Egyptian words, especially proper nouns, in other languages/writing systems?

Did in addition, because Egyptian not recorded over a full 2000 years, the Archaic and Late stages being separated by the amount of time that separates Old Latin from Modern Italian, significant phonetic changes must have occurred during that lengthy time frame?

Did here not the vowel system reconstructed for earlier Egyptian: Vowels are always short in unstressed syllables (‚ü®tpj‚ü©=* /taÀàpij/ 'first') and long in open stressed syllables (‚ü®rm·πØ‚ü©=* /ÀàraÀêmac/ 'man'), they but can be either short or long in closed stressed syllables (‚ü®jnn‚ü©=* /jaÀànan/ 'we', ‚ü®mn‚ü©=* /maÀên/ 'to stay')?

Did examples include ebony (Egyptian ìçÅìàñìè≠ìÜ± hbny, via Greek and then Latin), ivory (Egyptian Íú£bw, literally 'ivory, elephant'), natron (via Greek), lily (via Greek, from Coptic hlƒìri), ibis (via Greek, from Egyptian hbj), oasis (via Greek, from Demotic w·∏•j), perhaps barge (possibly from Greek baris `` Egyptian boat '', from Coptic bari `` small boat ''), and possibly cat; and of course a number of terms and proper names directly associated with Ancient Egypt, such as pharaoh (Egyptian ìâêìâª pr-Íú•Íú£, literally `` great house '', transmitted via Hebrew and Greek)?

Did however, Sahaidic and Bohairic preserve* /Ààa/, and Fayyumic renders it as ‚ü®e‚ü© in the presence of guttural fricatives: ‚ü®·∏èbÍú•‚ü© 'ten thousand'* /Ààba ï/> Sahaidic, Akhmimic and Lycopolitan ‚ü®tba‚ü©, Bohairic ‚ü®t ∞ba‚ü©, Fayyumic ‚ü®tbe‚ü©?
